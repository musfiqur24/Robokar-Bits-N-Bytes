Robokar is a cutting-edge teaching tool that teaches pupils the
foundations of robotics and programming. Robokar, which is based on
the Arduino platform, provides students with practical learning
opportunities to enhance their comprehension of robotics, electronics,
and software engineering. Robokar performs better when a Real-Time
Operating System (RTOS) is integrated because it can manage several
activities at once and react fast to motor orders and sensor inputs. This
functionality is essential for handling dynamic surroundings and carrying
out intricate manoeuvres.
Embedding Real-Time and Concurrent Software Development in RoboCar System
A microprocessor, power supply, actuators, and sensors are all part of
Robokar's architecture, and they're all coordinated by a hardware
abstraction layer to make programming easier. By ensuring effective task
scheduling, the RTOS allows the robot to carry out multiple tasks at
once, including navigation, motor control, and collision detection. By
putting RTOS into practice, students learn sophisticated programming
techniques, resource management, and job schedulingâ€”all of which are
necessary for today's embedded systems and robots.
Concurrent programming with RTOS allows Robokar to perform
significantly better in terms of response times, obstacle avoidance, and
navigation accuracy. To further develop Robokar's capabilities, future
work will concentrate on refining power management, strengthening task
scheduling, improving sensor accuracy, and optimising code structure.
This paper highlights Robokar's significance in promoting technical
skills and interest in robotics and automation by providing a thorough
review of its design, implementation, and educational impact
